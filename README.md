# PixelArtMaker
Final project in Google Udacity Developer Challenge 2017.
Used HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery.

It is a single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas.
Users can :
- Dynamically set the size of the table
- Choose a color
- Click a cell in the grid to fill it with chosen color
- Delete the color from the filled cell with another click on it

Goal is to learn how to interact with the DOM and to use event listeners.
